## Background and Motivation
Since 2009, the [United States](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/school-shooting-us-versus-world-trnd/index.html) has had over 57 times as many school shootings as Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and the UK combined. This is not a statistic you want your country to be leading in.
[Trends](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/07/us/ten-years-of-school-shootings-trnd/) show school shootings are on the rise. They are more likely to happen in urban areas and the risk of casualities increases if the student body is primarily white.


As a former education for almost a decade I have personally participated in countless active shooter/lockout drills and had conversations/answers student questions about what would happen if a stranger where to come to our classroom with a gun.

## The Data
The data consists of three different data sets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/):

- [School Shootings US 1990-Present](https://www.kaggle.com/ecodan/school-shootings-us-1990present)

- [Firearms Provisions In US States](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/state-firearms)

- [Gun Ownership By State](https://www.kaggle.com/solorzano/gun-ownership-by-state)
